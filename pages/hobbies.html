    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <p>In my free time, I love doing a bit of gardening and cooking.</p> 
    <p>They help me relax, especially after a stressful or not-so-good day.</p>

    <h2>Gardening</h2>

    <p>I've been a plant lover since I was a little girl. I was fond of picking flowers and seeds wherever I went.</p>
    <p>My favorite flower is the <strong>rose</strong>. I love all the colors and have a few of them in my garden.</p>
    <p>I also love amaryllis and gerbera flowers, cactuses, succulents, aromatic plants and veggies.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>

    <p>I love making pastries. I like everything that's chocolate.</p>
    <p>Every time I search for new recipes online and try them.</p>
    <p>I even love watching a lot of culinary programs to learn all the techniques.</p>
